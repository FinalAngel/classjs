Class.js - Simple Class Based Inheritance
=========================================

https://github.com/finalangel/classjs

Class.js is a JavaScript library for building class based object-oriented programms using JavaScript's prototypal
inheritance. It strives to mimic classical class inheritance provided by other languages such as Python, Java or PHP.
Its syntax is heavily inspired by MooTools's class implementation.
