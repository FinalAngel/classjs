Contribution guide
******************

All open-source projects live through their community, so does class.js. You are very welcome to contribute
bug fixes and feature proposals. Please note the following guidelines:

* class.js is hosted on github: http://github.com/FinalAngel/classjs

* Use github's issues tracker to submit bug fixes or feature proposals

* Whenever possible include a `jsfiddle <http://jsfiddle.net>`_ to an issue.

* It is good practice to fork a project and make your changes through your own fork.

* Always send a pull request with a reference to the github ticket.

* Include enough information within your commit messages and pull request to make life easier for us.


Don't feel offended if a pull or feature request has been rejected. We always provide reasonable comments
or information's about how your code could be improved.

Start by fixing or extending the documentation ;)
